This archive contains all the code that produces our experiments as presented in our paper:

H. Kaplan, S. Schnapp, U. Stemmer, "Differentially Private Approximate Quantiles".

To run our experiments of dp approximate quantiles run the code in run_dp_experiments.py.
To only run our Approximate Quantiles (AQ) algorithm run the code in run_dp_approximate_quantiles.py.

-----------------
Environment
-----------------

Before you run the code, check that you have python 3.6 installed on your device.
Then go to code directory and set the PYTHONPATH to the code directory using the following command line:
sudo export PYTHONPATH="./"

----------------------
Module dependencies
----------------------
python3.6 -m pip install numpy
python3.6 -m pip install matplotlib
python3.6 -m pip install torch

For running our experiments you will need to download the code of the baseline algorithms from:
https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/dp_multiq
and put it at the following path:"./google_research/dp_multiq"
